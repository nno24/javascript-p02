-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are white, grey and black.
            Embedded media elements and pictures have original color.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Apple-system font is the main font used throughout the whole website with BlinkMacSystemFont as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Apple-system is a clean font used frequently in web design, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The background image of the artist creates a modern contrast with the foreground elements and a cathy vibe. The fallback background color is set to rbg(27,27,27).
        The other images used througout the page are pictures of the artist and cover art pictures
        used for his songs.

        #### Media
        -  The media elements used thorughout the page, songs and videos, are mostly embedded elements from streaming platforms and online stores. It creates an efficient and easy way
        for a user to browse or purchase the artist's contents.

        #### Social Media
        -  The footer has all social media links with icons making it easy for the user to click
        and follow.
